'''The whole idea is the that gnome looks to his side.
case 1: no flowerpot to the gnome's side, task done, end. 
case 2: flowerpot to the gnome's side but 
no pot behind this one, take step forward
case 3: flower pot to the side and one behind are not in 
the right order, gnome swaps them and takes one step back'''
